## About Me
I'm a passionate developer on a journey to build cool things with code! I studied at Dr. B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar (NIT Jalandhar), where I discovered my love for programming and problem-solving. From tinkering with simple scripts to working on full-fledged projects, I’ve always been fascinated by the power of technology to bring ideas to life.

- **Continuous Learning:** I love the ever-evolving nature of technology. There's always something new to learn and implement!
- **Building Things:** Whether it’s automating a task or building a full-stack web application, the process of creating something from scratch excites me.

## My Skills
- **Languages:** JavaScript, C++,
- **Tools:** Node.js, React, MongoDB, Puppeteer
- **Other Interests:** Algorithms, Data Structures, LeetCode Challenges
